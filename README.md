# WeboscketChatServer

Requirements:

NodeJS
NPM
Bower
MongoDB

To run: 

In a command window, run `npm start` in root folder.
In separate command window, run: `node express.js` in root folder
Ensure mongodb is running locally on port 7999 (you can change this in server.js, still need to refactor this into command line args and/or properties file)
